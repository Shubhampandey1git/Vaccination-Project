# **ðŸ’‰Vaccination Project**

This end-to-end project enables us to analyze global vaccination data to understand trends in vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and effectiveness. Data will be cleaned, and stored in a SQL database. Power BI will be used to connect to the SQL database and create interactive dashboards that provide insights on vaccination strategies and their impact on disease control.
